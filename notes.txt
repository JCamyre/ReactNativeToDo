Expo - framework for universal Recat applications. Tools and services to develop/build/deploy for ios/android/web apps using the same code
What are these tools and services ???
Expo go - literally scan QR code to see how the project is going (QR code sends you to project in the Expo go app)
Pretty cool NGL, connects via network, not even cable, insta refreshes too



NativeBase - React native components, cool UI stuff

Typescript - Javascript but you can define your own types, somehow really op. 
type Props = {
    children: React.ReactNode;
}
Gonna assume this says for Props objects the children (between tags) are React.ReactNode objects

Having a full file dedicated to managing themes (theme.ts), so you can have a light/dark mode, 

A src folder dedicatd to screens, similar to pages in regular React?

useColorMode
useColorModeValue('red.500', 'yellow.500'), first theme uses red, second theme uses yellow
Explanation of components:
NavigationContainer - Navigating between screens (similar to Router)
NativeBaseProvider - stuff for handling themes
Center - For centering components
Vstack - Stack components vertically
Box - A box to hold other components, change dimensions
HStack - Stack components horizontally
Switch - A switch to toggle things, has isChecked and onToggle parameters/attributes
